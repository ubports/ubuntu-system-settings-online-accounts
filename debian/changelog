  [ Alberto Mardegan ]
  * Move OnlineAccounts into its own process Create the
    com.canonical.OnlineAccountsUI D-Bus service, whose task is to show
    the Online Accounts UI when clients request it. The SystemSettings
    plugin for Online Accounts becomes just one of these clients. The
    rationale for the change is that it has been decided by design that
    multiple instances of Online Accounts can be running at the same
    time (because the Online Accounts UI will be modal to the
    application which invoked it), yet they need to coordinate in order
    to avoid the creation of the same account in two different places.
    Using a single process with multiple windows and exposing a D-Bus
    API seems to be the best approach and is also flexible enough to
    accomodate for most of the design changes that might pop up. It's
    also a proved approach, used already by signon-ui (in fact, most of
    the code is taken from there). .
  * Implement window transiency Let the service know what QWindow is
    active in the client process, and use that one as parent window for
    the transiency.

    the panel side, only the initiation of account creation by provider
    name is implemented; the service-type filtering requires some more
